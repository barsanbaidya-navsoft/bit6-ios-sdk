Bit6 is a real-time, cloud-based communications-as-a-service platform that allows mobile and web application developers to quickly and easily add voice/video calling, texting, and multimedia messaging capabilities as a feature to their apps. In addition Bit6 provides a suite of essential services including Identity Management, Social Map, and Virtual Wallet to help integrate the communication capabilities into a complete end-user experience.

### SDK and Sample App

#### Before You Begin
To use the SDK and the sample app:

* Get your unique API key [here](http://bit6.com/contact/)
* Upload your APNS (push) certificate - instructions will be provided together with the API key

#### How to Use the Sample App
The sample app is made as simple as possible to demonstrate the use of the Bit6 SDK. The interface is therefore minimalistic and only includes the essential elements.

To see the sample app in action, you will need to creat two users:

* Open the Bit6 sample app
* Tap 'Sign up'
* Type a username and a password, then 'Done'

You will be able to send text, photo, video, voice messages, and location between the two users. For the ultimate experience you need to upload the APNS certificate.
